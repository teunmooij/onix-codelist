			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th class="notation">Value</th>
						<th class="preflabel">Description</th>
						<th class="notes">Notes</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>01</td>
						<td>Early notification</td>
						<td>Use for a complete record issued earlier than approximately six months before publication</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>02</td>
						<td>Advance notification (confirmed)</td>
						<td>Use for a complete record issued to confirm advance information approximately six months before publication; or for a complete record issued after that date and before information has been confirmed from the book-in-hand</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>03</td>
						<td>Notification confirmed on publication</td>
						<td>Use for a complete record issued to confirm advance information at or just before actual publication date, usually from the book-in-hand, or for a complete record issued at any later date</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>04</td>
						<td>Update (partial)</td>
						<td>In ONIX 3.0 only, use when sending a ‘block update’ record. A block update implies using the supplied block(s) to update the existing record for the product, replacing only the blocks included in the block update, and leaving other blocks unchanged – for example, replacing old information from Blocks 4 and 6 with the newly-received data while retailing information from Blocks 1–3 and 5 untouched. In previous ONIX releases, and for ONIX 3.0 using other notification types, updating is by replacing the complete record with the newly-received data</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>05</td>
						<td>Delete</td>
						<td>Use when sending an instruction to delete a record which was previously issued. Note that a Delete instruction should NOT be used when a product is cancelled, put out of print, or otherwise withdrawn from sale: this should be handled as a change of Publishing status, leaving the receiver to decide whether to retain or delete the record. A Delete instruction is used ONLY when there is a particular reason to withdraw a record completely, eg because it was issued in error</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>08</td>
						<td>Notice of sale</td>
						<td>Notice of sale of a product, from one publisher to another: sent by the publisher disposing of the product</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>09</td>
						<td>Notice of acquisition</td>
						<td>Notice of acquisition of a product, by one publisher from another: sent by the acquiring publisher</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>88</td>
						<td>Test update (Partial)</td>
						<td>ONIX 3.0 only. Record may be processed for test purposes, but data should be discarded when testing is complete. Sender must ensure the &lt;RecordReference&gt; matches a previously-sent Test record</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>89</td>
						<td>Test record</td>
						<td>Record may be processed for test purposes, but data should be discarded when testing is complete. Sender must ensure the &lt;RecordReference&gt; does not match any previously-sent live product record</td>
					</tr>
