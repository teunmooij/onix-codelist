						<td>01</td>
						<td>Consignment</td>
						<td>The retailer pays for goods only after they are sold by the retailer to an end consumer, and may return excess unsold inventory to the supplier at any time. The goods remain the property of the supplier until they are paid for, even while they are physically located at the retailer</td>

						<td>Contact supplier for applicable returns authorization process. The retailer is invoiced for the goods immediately (or upon dispatch) and pays within the specified credit period, but can return excess unsold inventory to the supplier for full credit at a later date. Some kind of returns authorisation process is normally required. Returns must be in saleable conditon, except when return of stripped covers or proof of destruction may be allowed instead.

					<tr>
						<td>04</td>
