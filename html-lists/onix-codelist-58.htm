						<td>01</td>
						<td>RRP excluding tax</td>
						<td>Recommended Retail Price, excluding any sales tax or value-added tax. Price recommended by the publisher or supplier for retail sales to the consumer. Also termed the Suggested Retail Price (SRP) or Maximum Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) in some countries. The retailer may choose to use this recommended price, or may choose to sell to the consumer at a lower (or occasionally, a higher) price which is termed the Actual Selling Price (ASP) in sales reports. The net price charged to the retailer depends on the RRP minus a trade discount (which may be customer-specific). Relevant tax detail must be calculated by the data recipient</td>

Price fixed by the publisher or supplier for retail sales to the consumer. The retailer must use this price, or may vary the price only within certain legally-prescribed limits. The net price charged to the retailer depends on the FRP minus a customer-specific trade discount. Relevant tax detail must be calculated by the data recipient</td>

Relevant tax detail must be calculated by the data recipient</td>

						<td>Special sale RRP excluding any sales tax or value-added tax. Note ‘special sales’ are sales where terms and conditions are different from normal trade sales, when for example products that are normally sold on a sale-or-return basis are sold on firm-sale terms, where a particular product is tailored for a specific retail outlet (often termed a ‘premium’ product), or where other specific conditions or qualiifications apply. Further details of the modified terms and conditions should be given in &lt;PriceTypeDescription&gt;</td>

						<td>In the US, books are sometimes supplied on ‘freight-pass-through’ terms, where a price that is different from the RRP is used as the basis for calculating the supplier’s charge to a reseller. To make it clear when such terms are being invoked, code 31 is used instead of code 01 to indicate the RRP. Code 32 is used for the ‘billing price’</td>
